The folder structure is the common folder structure in node: routes, controllers, utils.


Do not forget to run ```npm install``` on your first time running the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, because it uses nodemon.

### `npm start`
Does the same thing but it does not reload when you make changes.
